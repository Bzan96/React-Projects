# This app was made as a part of a tutorial and was my introduction to using APIs in React, I learned:
* How to use fetch to get an API from an online database
* That instead of using a submit-button, or onSubmit(), in React you can just add a button to your form and it will act as a submit-button.
* About the position: absolute property and how one can use that to position text relating to images
* Some different syntax conventions to make life easier while working in React
